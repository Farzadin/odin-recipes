        <li>FOR THE <a href="https://persianmama.com/persian-steamed-rice/">AROMATIC RICE</a>:
            2 ½ cups rice
            1 ½ tsp <a href="https://persianmama.com/all-about-spices-2/">Persian Rice Spice</a>
            Pieces of lavash or flour tortilla for Tahdig</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <p>Melt butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the cubed beef, diced onion, turmeric powder, and ground
            black pepper (salt will be added later). Saute for 10 minutes until the meat is browned and the natural
            juices are bubbling.
        </p>

        <li>Step 2</li>
        <p>Add 3 cups water, cover, reduce heat to medium low and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the meat is tender.
            After the meat is cooked there should be about 2 ½ cups of broth in the pot.</p>

        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Meanwhile pick through the split peas for any possible debris. Add them to a small saucepan and fill the pan
            with cold water and wash the peas and discard the water. Add Fresh water to the saucepan and repeat couple
            of times to clean the peas.</p>

        <li>Step 4</li>
        <p>Next add enough cold water to cover the split peas by one inch. Add ½ tsp salt and bring the water to a boil
            over medium heat. Cook uncovered for 5-6 minutes, or until the split peas are more tender but still very
            firm. If the peas get fully cooked at this stage they will get mushy after they are cooked later with the
            meat and sauce. Drain the peas into a colander and rinse under cold water. Set aside.</p>

        <li>Step 5</li>
        <p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet and fry the sliced onions until golden brown. Add the tomato paste
            and saute for another 3-4 minutes until aromatic. Add the cooked split peas, 2 TBSP butter, ¼ cup crushed
            dried limes (about 2-3), ⅛ tsp optional saffron and 1 tsp Persian Meat Spice. Saute over medium low heat for
            5-8 minutes, stirring frequently.</p>

        <li>Step 6</li>
        <p>Add the cooked beef, broth, and 1 tsp kosher salt to the skillet. Stir to combine the ingredients. Add 2
            whole limes that have been soaking in hot water, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat to the mark
            between medium low and low. Cover and simmer for 35-40 minutes, or until the meat, split peas and dried
            limes are tender and the sauce has thickened.</p>

        <li>Step 7</li>
        <p>Meanwhile peel and slice the potatoes into ½-inch long sticks. Place the potatoes in a colander and rinse
            under cold water to get rid of the starch that is on the surface so the potatoes do not stick together when
            fried. Pat dry the potatoes with a paper towel before frying. If using the optional saffron, you will need
            to add the potatoes to a medium bowl and sprinkle a dash of saffron on the potatoes and toss to coat.</p>

        <li>Step 8</li>
        <p>Heat the ¼ cup vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. The oil should be very hot but not
            smoking. Gently add the potatoes to the hot oil and stir couple of times to coat all of the potatoes with
            oil, then fry them in a single layer for 15-20 minutes, stirring and turning so the potatoes are tender and
            light golden brown on all sides. Transfer the fried potatoes to a platter covered with a paper towel to
            absorb the excess oil. Immediately sprinkle the fries with about ¼ tsp kosher salt.</p>

        <li>Step 9</li>
        <p>To serve, add Steamed Aromatic Rice to the plates and add Gheymeh on top. Next top the Gheymeh with fried
            potatoes.</p>
